<h2> Al-Qarawiyyin Library </h2>
<section> 
	<h3> <i>Location: Fez, Morocco </i> </h3>
	<h3> Time period: 859 CE to present </h3> <h3>Status: remains in use</h3> 
</section>

<section> <p>The library was founded in the 2nd century CE by Fatima Al-Fihri, who had recived significant funds when her father, brother, and 
husband died within a short timespan. Al-Fihri was highly involved in the creation of the library, and oversaw the architecture and craftmanship
herself.Her manuscript collection remains in the library's collection.<br><br>Al-Qarawiyyin was primarly a mosque complex and learning centre, and is the 
worlds oldest continuiously running university. It has been suggested that teaching at the mosque likely dates back to it's early years or from the 
start, as mosques in the early Islamic period served as multi-functional buildings, with education, religious and civic activities. Overtime, 
Al-Qarawiyyin became a higher learning institution attracting scholars from all over the Muslim world, and eventually from Medival Europe as well.
The student body was traditionally boys and men, however there was a special gallery provided for women and girls to listen in on discussions. These
women could submit written questions for the teacher, and those showing an interest could recieve individual tuition.<br><br>The institution declined in 
the 18th century, with a shift to strictly traditional Islamic teachings, along with Arabic language and literature courses. Classes on medicine and 
astronomy were discontinued and faculty were steered away. During this change the library, previously attracting scholars from around the world, suffered
neglect. A large portion of the collection was lost, with the collection holding around 1,600 manuscripts and 400 books by the begining of the 20th century.
Previously the library had held thousands of books and manuscripts on diverse disciplines and in many languages.<br><br>Today the university remains in use, with
degrees in Arabic languages and literature, Islamic studies, and Moroccan culture and history being most popular. In 1947 it joined the state administered
education system, and as of 1963 it has been a state-run university, now called The University of Al-Qarawiyyin. In June 2015, the university became a 
public institution devoted to higher education and scientific research by royal decree. The mosque complex adjacent to the university remains a main mosque
and community centre. In 2012 the library was rehabilitated and opened to the public. Visitors can view manuscripts, a treatment lab for books, a tour
a small museum showcasing the site's history. Examples of notable manuscripts in the collection include sayings of the Prophet Muhammed by Imam Malik ibn Anas
 (in volumes of the Al-Muwatta collection of hadiths), and <cite>Biography of the Prophet</cite> by Ibn Ishaq, among others.   </p> </section>
