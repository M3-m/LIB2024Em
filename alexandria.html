<h2> Library of Alexandria </h2>
<section> 
	<h3> <i>Location: Egypt</i> </h3>
	<h3> Time period: Ptolemaic Dynasty, 323-330 BCE </h3> <h3>Status: Destroyed, unclear on how or when</h3> </section>
<section> <p> The library of Alexandria is the most famous ancient library. It was a preeminent intellectual center, attracting scholars from
from around the Mediterranean. Male scholars, scientists, poets, literary critics, writers, and more lived with room and board at the site,
and were given a token salary for life. All of the scholars living onsite were expected to teach in some capacity, allowing the greatest minds
of the time to devote themselves to studying and teaching free from distractions from daily life.<br><br>The library declined after 145 BCE, a time of 
political strife and the banishing of foreign scholars. The focus of the library shifted away from being a knowledge centre, with head librarians
being appointed for their political alligence, rather than for scholarly achievement. There are many different competing sources citing how the 
library was destroyed, and it remains unclear how the library met it's fate.  </p> </section> 
<section> 
<ul> 
	<li>The names of the head librarians are known.</li> 
	<li>Head librarians were appointed by the royal court, and served for life.</li> 
	<li>Head librarian Zenodotus was the first to implement an alphabetical organizational system to library holdings.</li>
	<li>Ships docking in Alexandria would have their books confiscated. The owners would be returned a copy of the original work, which would
	remain in the library</li>
</ul>
