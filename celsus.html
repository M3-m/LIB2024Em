<h2> Library of Celsus </h2>
<section> 
	<h3> <i>Location: Ancient Ephesus (modern day Turkey) </i> </h3>
	<h3> Time period: 117-262 CE </h3> <h3>Status: In ruins </h3> </section>
<section> <p> The Library of Celsus was commissioned by Roman Emperor Tiberius Julius Acquila in 114 CE. The building was completed in 117 CE. 
The library contained over 12,000 scrolls that were meant to be consulted on site. The library had a main floor and a second level railed balcony.
The building was designed to preserve the scrolls, with niches constructed into the walls which worked to reduce humidity and regulate temperature.
<br>The building was also a mausoleum, built for Tiberus Julius Acquila's father, whom the building is named after. He was entombed in a lead coffin
 within a marble sarcophagus that was buried under the library. The statues flanking the three doorways were intended to represent four qualities 
that were associated with the late emperor Celsus; wisdom, intellignece, knowledge, and virtue.<br><br> The library was destroyed in a fire during a 
Gothic invasion in 262 CE, but the facade survived. Repairs were made to the building in the late 4th century, which then collapsed in an earthquake
 in the 10th century. The site was excavated in 1904. During the excavation the sarcophagus of Emperor Celsus was discovered, and the facade was
 reassembled and partially restored. Today the library facade reamins open for visitation.  </p>

<section> 
<ul> 
	<li>The library's floor space is 180 square metres</li> 
	<li>A large statue, either depicting Celsus or his son, was found in the interior of the building and is now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul. </li> 
	<li>The library was designed to appear larger than it is, using a gently convexed podium and making the columns, capitals, and rafters bigger in the centre of the building.</li>
	<li>The statues currently at the front of the library's facade are copies. The originals are in Vienna.</li>
