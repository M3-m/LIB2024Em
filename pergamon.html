<h2> Library of Pergamon </h2>
<section> 
	<h3> <i>Location: Pergamon, Asia Minor (modern day Bergama, Turkey) </i> </h3>
	<h3> Time period: Established sometime between 197-150 BCE, lasted until the early years of the Byzantine Empire.  </h3> <h3>Status: In ruins </h3> </section>
<section> 
	<p> The Library of Pergamon was established by the Attalid king Eumenes II, who ruled 197-159 BCE. This library was one of the most famous
	and well repected learning centres of the ancient world after the Library of Alexandria. The two libraries were rivals, each fighting for the title
	of top learning centre. As a result Egypt denied Pergamon papyrus and banned its production [outside of Egypt?] , causing Pergamon to switch to 
	parchement. Eumenes II was ruthless in building the collection, people living in the Pergamene territory would bury their books to prevent them 
	being taken by royalty.<br><br>The library is said to have held 200,000 books at its height. There are no records of use stipulations, and it is assumed
	from the Attalids interest in wide spread education that the resources were widely available. The library was located on the Pergamon acropolis, as 
	an annex to Eumenes II's Temple of Athena. It was designed as a modest building, focused on book preservation and ascetic beauty.<br><br> Rome continued 
	to maintain the library after they acquired Asia Minor. According to the ancient historian Plutarch, Marc Antony gave the entire collection to 
	Cleopatra as a gift for the Library of Alexandria. Julius Caesar returned some scrolls to Pergamon in 43 BCE, but it never regained it's popularity 
	and status. Pergamon was damaged in 262 CE in an earthquake, but evidence suggests that the library remained in operation during the early years of 
	the Byzantine Empire, but its final fate is unknown. The city was abandoned sometime after c. 1300 CE, and librarians and scholar would have likely 
	taken any remaining materials with them.

	<li>One of the head librarians, Crates of Mallus (2nd century BCE), constructed the first known globe.</li> 
	<li>Due to Egypt denying Pergamon the papyrus required to make books the city became the centre of parchment manufacturing. The word parchement 
	comes from the Latin term pergamenum, referencing the city of Pergamon.</li> 
	<li>Site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014.</li>
